        <div class = "info-1-content">
            <p> The brain is the body's control center, made up of billions of 
                nerve cells that work together to help us think, feel, move, and
                experience the world. It processes information from our senses,
                like sight and sound, and controls actions like breathing, 
                walking, and talking. The brain also helps us learn, 
                remember things, and make decisions. It's divided into 
                different parts, each with specialized roles, such as controlling 
                emotions, balancing the body, or solving problems. The brain is 
                essential for everything we do, 
                from simple movements to complex thoughts and emotions.

        <div class = "content">
            <h2>So how do we understand it?</h2>
            <p> We can study how it processes 
                information, controls the body, and supports thought and emotion. 
                Scientists use tools like brain scans (MRI, fMRI, EEG) to observe 
                its activity and see which areas are involved in tasks like 
                thinking, speaking, or moving. By studying people with brain 
                injuries or disorders, we learn how different parts of the brain 
                work. Research on animals and experiments that track electrical 
                signals in neurons also help us understand how the brain 
                communicates. Together, these methods give us insight into how the 
                brain enables learning, memory, and behavior.

    <section aria-label="Paragraph about why we exhibit certain behaviors" id="information-3">
        <img src="https://brain.cuhk.edu.hk/images/mri.gif" alt="MRI Brain GIF">
        <h2>And why do we behave the way we do?</h2>
        <div class = "info-3-content">
            <p>Our behavior is based on how our brain processes 
                information, combines past experiences, and responds to our 
                environment. Behavior is shaped by a complex interaction of brain 
                activity, emotions, memories, and external influences. Different 
                parts of the brain work together to make decisions, control 
                impulses, and adapt to situations. Genetics and chemical messengers, 
                like hormones and neurotransmitters, are also involved in influencing 
                our actions and moods. Ultimately, behavior is the result of our 
                brain trying to help us navigate and survive in the world. </p>
