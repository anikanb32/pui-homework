## Idea Sketches

### *Idea 1*

![Timeline Portfolio](images/sketch-1.png)


This project would convert my existing portfolio into my own code and design that
I have more flexibility with. I would implement this idea of a timeline visual 
where people can scroll to see how my research and project focuses have shifted
over my time as an undergrad. 

I would make the design interactive to users by including striking visuals, and 
allow for interaction with the timeline tool. Along with this, I would focus on 
making the design accessible by including contrast as well as larger, more legible
font. 


### *Idea 2*

![Neuroscience Learning Tool](images/sketch-2.png)

With this project, I would create an interactive platform to guide users in learning
more about the brain and specific conditions - such as neurodegenerative diseases,
addictions, and cognitive functions (the chemistry behind mental health). 
This tool could have an interactive brain map to learn about different areas
and have some concepts like "exploring the neural network" or "follow the synapse" 
interactions. 

I would need to use D3.js and other APIs to help visualize the brain map and other 
elements of the site. Accessibility would be highlighted with clear contrast and 
legibility. The goal here would be to communicate complex concepts in a way that 
is accessbile to a wide audience. 


### *Idea 3*

![AR Learning Tool](images/sketch-3.png)

I spent this past summer doing research for AR environments, and was interested in 
creating a tool to cover the basic elements of AR designs and 3D spatial maps. 
With this project, I would create a tool that visualizes common design patterns 
in AR interfaces which could be interactive, allowing users to see examples of each pattern
and understand the best scenarios for each. Accessible interactive tools would 
be important to consider, given movement with keystrokes as well as the trackpad
and color contrast throughout the visuals.  It would be important to consider 
how the AR patterns would map to real world scenarios and I would also need to learn 
how to embed AR-appearing environments within the website. 



## Feedback Summary
