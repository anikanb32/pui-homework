## Idea Sketches

### *Idea 1 - Timeline Portfolio*

This project would convert my existing portfolio into my own code and design that
I have more flexibility with. I would implement this idea of a timeline visual 
where people can scroll to see how my research and project focuses have shifted
over my time as an undergrad. 

I would make the design interactive to users by including striking visuals, and 
allow for interaction with the timeline tool. Along with this, I would focus on 
making the design accessible by including contrast as well as larger, more legible
font. 


### *Idea 2 - Neuroscience Learning Tool*

With this project, I would create an interactive platform to guide users in learning
more about the brain and specific conditions - such as neurodegenerative diseases,
addictions, and cognitive functions (the chemistry behind mental health). 
This tool could have an interactive brain map to learn about different areas
and have some concepts like "exploring the neural network" or "follow the synapse" 
interactions. 

I would need to use D3.js and other APIs to help visualize the brain map and other 
elements of the site. Accessibility would be highlighted with clear contrast and 
legibility. The goal here would be to communicate complex concepts in a way that 
is accessbile to a wide audience. 


### *Idea 3 - AR Interaction Tool*

I spent this past summer doing research for AR environments, and was interested in 
creating a tool to cover the basic elements of AR designs and 3D spatial maps. 
With this project, I would create a tool that visualizes common design patterns 
in AR interfaces which could be interactive, allowing users to see examples of each pattern
and understand the best scenarios for each. Accessible interactive tools would 
be important to consider, given movement with keystrokes as well as the trackpad
and color contrast throughout the visuals.  It would be important to consider 
how the AR patterns would map to real world scenarios and I would also need to learn 
how to embed AR-appearing environments within the website. 



## Feedback Summary

For the first idea, I got feedback that creating my own portfolio into a coded, custom version gives the flexibility to create my timeline idea. It can represent the journey idea through a timeline. I would need to think more about how users could navigate the timeline - whether it would be long and use scrolling, or be more clicking. How long should this be on the main page etc. It also might be interesting to find other elements to use to make it more unique and different than my current portfolio. An important thing that I got as feedback, is that I already have a portfolio website, so this might not make as much sense to focus my time on. 

For the second idea, the neuroscience learning tool, I got more positive feedback. This has a lot more educational value and helps visualize and simplify complex topics. They mentioned that they need to have some interactive element to move around and look into maybe D3.js and APIs - this is something I would need to look into. There were some points brought up about simulating addiction through habitual tasks as well as addictive substances like sugar. To make this more visually interesting they mentioned using videos, animations, and other content to cater to diverse learning styles. 

The last idea I presented was the AR interaction tool, which focuses on learning AR applications and current use cases. The feedback I got was to convert this to more of an educational tool - where there could be embedded real world examples, and detailed applications - for example in user testing, providing alternative educational and learning resources for classrooms. This could also be accompanied by technical learning resources to understand more about technical HCI. Overall the feedback made me feel more hesitant about this idea - defining the scope and executing a useful product. 


## Feedback Digestion

My interpretation of the criticism led me to believe that the second idea was the most interesting and feasible. Firstly, when it comes to creating a portfolio, it would not be as beneficial considering I already have an existing portfolio and the timeline element could be a smaller project that would require slightly less time. For the last idea, I came to the conclusion that the scope was not as defined as the other two ideas, which makes it difficult to understand the APIs and how to embed certain features. I would need to experiment and practice with creating AR visuals and patterns - which I am not as familiar with yet. Because this also may not be as useful for users - less engaging and there may not be as much of a need as in learning about the brain and interactions that we experience everyday.  

Focusing on the second idea with neuroscience, I plan to create a 3D model of the brain using APIs or other javascript interaction libraries. This would be both useful as well as interesting to users. I could have an interactive brain map that has clickable regions of the brain - providing information about functions, associated conditions and research related to these areas. 
There could be learning modules or some type of simulation to show the onset of neurodegenerative diseases and the process of declining cognitive function - this could include interactive and clickable infographics or embedded videos. There could be interactive learning activities or games like ‘follow the synapse” to let signals travel in the brain and share scenarios related to conditions. Furthermore, after discussing with peers, I would emphasize accessibility features such as contrast, alt text for images or data visualizations, and keyboard navigation and support.
